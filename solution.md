The above plot shows us the trend of beer consumption in the Netherlands between 2006 and 2018. We can see that it follows a rather stable trend between 2006 and 2012 and that it then starts to increase dramatically. It is important to note, however, that the graph starts at 11400 hectoliters on the y-axis, meaning that what looks like a very steep increase on the graph between 2012 and 2018 is actually only a 5% increase over 6 years.
